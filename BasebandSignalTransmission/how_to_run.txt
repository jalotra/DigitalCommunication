This python module can be used as a standalone to work simulate Baseband Signal Transmission.

How it works :
Theory:
In Baseband communication we have a audio signal that we want to transmit by sampling it at 
a constant time interval (T) . But if the noise power is much greater than the power that the
baseband signal contains then it can distort the signal, thus increasing the error in sent information.

What we do :
We create a matched filter that in theory has a impulse response that looks like this: 
K*g(T-t) where K is some constant that can be tuned , and T is the sampling Time Period.
